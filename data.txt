    m|0|Welcome to the year 1914, situated in the Philippines, a colony of the United States of America. You are currently standing in front of a branch of the Intercontinental Bank, holding a leather briefcase containing thousands of pesos. You were instructed by your manager to deposit a large sum of money to a private account in another bank. What are you going to do now?%n
    m|1|You are talking to someone now.
    m|2|You've picked up a rock.%nA person is approaching you from far away, waving.
    m|3|You waved back and the person ran towards you.%n"Don't you remember me?" He asked.
    m|4|"You've got to be kidding!" He answered back, taking something from their pockets.
